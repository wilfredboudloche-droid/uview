      You’ve just been hired as an <strong>entry-level IT support specialist</strong> at a mid-sized company.
      It’s 8:00 AM, and your ticketing system already shows several new requests:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Ticket 1:</strong> A teacher can’t connect her laptop to the classroom projector.</li>
      <li><strong>Ticket 2:</strong> A student reports they can’t log into their school email.</li>
      <li><strong>Ticket 3:</strong> A staff member’s desktop keeps randomly restarting.</li>
      <li><strong>Ticket 4:</strong> A new employee needs their account and computer set up.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      As the IT support specialist, it’s your job to decide <strong>what to tackle first</strong> and how to communicate with each person.
